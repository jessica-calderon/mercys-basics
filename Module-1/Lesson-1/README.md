# Lesson 1.1: Understanding Hardware and Software

Welcome to Lesson 1.1 of Module 1 in the Introduction to Technology and Cybersecurity Course. This lesson is a foundational crash course into the basic components of computer hardware and software concepts.

## Lesson Objectives
- To identify and understand the key components of computer hardware.
- To comprehend the basic concepts and types of software.
- To recognize the interrelationship between hardware and software.

## Crash Course Content

### Introduction to Computer Hardware
Computer hardware is the physical part of a computer, including the digital circuitry. As an introduction, we'll focus on the core components:

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Often referred to as the brain of the computer, it handles instructions and processes data from software.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: This is the short-term memory of a computer, where data is stored for quick access while the machine is running.
- **Storage (Hard Drives and SSDs)**: Devices for long-term data storage. Hard drives are older and slower compared to solid-state drives (SSDs), which are faster and more reliable.
- **Motherboard**: The main circuit board that connects all components of the computer, allowing them to communicate with each other.
- **Power Supply**: Converts electricity from your wall outlet into a form that the computer can use.
- **Peripherals**: Devices like the monitor, keyboard, and mouse that allow interaction with the computer.

### Introduction to Computer Software
Software refers to the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. It is the non-tangible component of computers. Software can be broadly categorized into:

- **System Software**: This includes operating systems like Windows, macOS, or Linux, which manage the hardware and create an environment for other software to run.
- **Application Software**: These are programs that perform specific tasks for users, such as word processors, web browsers, and email clients.

### The Relationship Between Hardware and Software
- Computers operate on the basis of the IPOS (Input-Process-Output-Storage) cycle. Hardware components perform input, output, and storage functions, while software provides the processing logic.
- Understanding how hardware and software interact is crucial for troubleshooting and optimizing computer performance.

## Activities and Assignments
- **Activity 1**: Identify the hardware components in a computer diagram.
- **Activity 2**: List and categorize five software applications you commonly use.
- **Assignment 1**: Write a short essay explaining the function of the CPU in a computer system.
